##TwelveTwentyToolkit-ObjC
Twelve Twenty's Toolkit of reusable Objective-C classes.

##Granularity through Cocoapods
This library is a collection of classes used by us here at Twelve Twenty. They contain a range of classes, categories and regular C utility functions.

If you want to use these files in your project, we recommend using the magnificient [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) project. Check out the subspecs for control over granular use of the toolkit.
